# JSONtoCSV
Automation project for my internship at RBC. 
This Python script reads and converts JSON to CSV and adds it to an Excel file as a new sheet. 
The script is used to update the GCS team's master spreadsheet, instructions and demo video were uploaded to RBC's Confluence page for employees to use
